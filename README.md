## Get Started Quickly

### ðŸ›  **Deploy Sanity Studio**

1. **Clone your repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd your-repo-name/studio
   ```

2. **Initialize Sanity Studio**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx sanity init --env
   ```

   This will generate a `.env` file in the `studio` directory.

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   In the generated .env file, add the following:

   ```bash
   SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL="<your-vercel-app-url>"
   ```

   Replace `<your-vercel-app-url>` with the URL of your Vercel-hosted Next.js app.

4. **Import Demo Data (optional)**:

   If you want to start with some sample content, you can import the provided dataset (demoData.tar.gz) into your Sanity project. This step is optional but can be helpful for getting started quickly.

   To import the dataset, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx sanity dataset import demoData.tar.gz production
   ```

   > **Note:** If you're using a different dataset name, replace `production` with your dataset name.

5. **Deploy your Studio**:

   ```bash
   npx sanity deploy
   ```

   You'll be prompted to set a URL for your deployed Sanity Studio (e.g., `https://your-project-name.sanity.studio`). Take note of this URL as you'll need it in the next step.

### ðŸ”§ 3. **Configure Next.js with Sanity Studio URL**

1. Go to your **Vercel Project's Dashboard** > Settings > Environment Variables.
2. Add:
   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_STUDIO_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Sanity Studio's URL (e.g., `https://your-project.sanity.studio`).
3. Redeploy your Next.js app to apply changes.

> **Tip:** You can redeploy your Next.js app by clicking **Deployments** and clicking the three dots on the right of your latest deployment and selecting **Redeploy**.

## Running Locally

When developing your app, you'll run the files locally. Pushing your changes to the repo will trigger a build on Vercel and your changes will be deployed automatically. You can deploy your Sanity Studio at any time by running `npx sanity deploy` in the `studio` directory, as we did earlier.

### Run Next.js App Locally

1. **Set environment variables**:

   - Use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to link and pull environment variables:
     ```bash
     cd nextjs-app
     vercel link
     vercel env pull .env.development.local
     ```
   - You can also copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and complete the required values. Your `projectId` and `dataset` can be found in your Sanity project's [**Manage Console**](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and selecting your project.

2. **Install dependencies and run the Next.js app**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Run Sanity Studio Locally

1.  **Set up environment variables**:

- Change directories to the `studio` directory:
- Create a `.env.local` file by duplicating the `.env` file or copying `.env.local.example`
- Fill in the `projectId` and `dataset` values, same as the Next.js app.
- Set `SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL` to the localhost URL of your Next.js app or you can leave it blank and the app will fallback to the default `localhost:3000`.
- Lastly, you'll want to add `localhost:3000` as a CORS origin in your Sanity [**Manage Console**](https://www.sanity.io/manage), located under **API** > **CORS Origins**.

2.  **Install dependencies and run the Sanity Studio**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
